If you are having a hard time buying or selling, let\'s take a look. To start, Titano requires a tax of **13%** to buy and **18%** to sell.

Now, ensure that slippage is set to **13% for a buy order** and **18% for a sell order** as a base on Pancakeswap and gradually increase by **1%** until the transaction succeeds.

Currently Pancakeswap works with **15% buy slippage** and **22% sell slippage**

We recommend you to use Bogged Finance to buy/sell TITANO with ease:
