If you are having a hard time buying or selling, let\'s take a look. To start, Titano requires a tax of **13%** to buy and **18%** to sell.

Now, ensure that slippage is set to **13% for a buy order** and **18% for a sell order** as a base on Pancakeswap and gradually increase by **1%** until the transaction succeeds.

You can also use PooCoin to set auto-slippage if this still doesn\'t work.

You can find the links in the <#913849034094051399> channel.
