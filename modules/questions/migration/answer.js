Tokens use Smart Contracts to operate on the blockchain. 
Smart Contracts, once deployed, cannot be updated. 
A new Smart Contract built together with Certik will have to be deployed for the new changes to take place. 
This results in investors having to migrate from the old contract to the new one. 

**You don't have to do anything with your tokens now**

**Why will we migrate?**
• New contract will remove certain FUD-related functions (minting, rescueTokens, taxes)
• Removed blacklist/whitelist functions
• Improved security
• New code additions and optimizations

More information on how the migration is done will be announced days before the event.
We expect the migration to take place by the end of this month on our Official Titano website.

*We will prepare tutorials for the migration. Mods will be there to guide you*
